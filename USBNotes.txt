Careful reading of chapter 5


Packet vs. transaction vs. transfer
	???

Transfer types vs. pipe types (message & stream)
	Where does isochronous fit into this?
		Spec says "If a non-isochronous pipe..."
		"When a pipe is established for an endpoint, most of the pipeâ€™s transfer characteristics are determined and remain fixed for the lifetime of the pipe"
		"An isochronous pipe is a stream pipe and is, therefore, always uni-directional."
		"Message pipes support the control transfer type, which is explained in Section 5.5."

Christ, this is so confusing.  Control pipe === message pipe?  And that's apparently the only use for the control transfer type?  Why are there so many terms for the same thing?


Packet sizes?



Transaction vs. transfer?
	Looks basically synonymous based on the 8.5 table of contents.


STALL? HALT? NAK?
	These are types of *handshake packets* and are explained in table 8-1 and below.
	STALL is for critical error handling?


USB resets and what they mean (reset the device? or just the USB state machine?)



What is a packet, really?
	5.4: "The data for any IRP is carried by the data field of the data packet as described in Section 8.3.4"





STM32F: The USB peripheral interfaces with the USB host, detecting token packets, handling data transmission/reception, and processing handshake packets as required by the USB standard. Transaction formatting is performed by the hardware, including CRC generation and checking.


"Sequence bit synchronization"?
